# React Blended 2

## Getting Started

- Fork the repository;
- Clone the repository to your PC/laptop;
- Install dependencies using `npm i`;
- Explore the repository structure;

> **NOTE:** The starter files include the necessary set of components, helper files, and functions to create two applications. To separate these two tasks, tabs have been implemented in the `App` component for switching between them. The `react-tabs` library is used to split the interface and connect the two main components - `Todos` and `Photos`. These components are located in `src/tabs/` and the tasks themselves are performed within these components, not in `App`.

### Tasks

- [TODO LIST (Module 3)](/task_1-todos.md)
- [Image Search (Module 4)](/task_2-photos.md)
